        At the moment, there are 7 main story tasks in Red Dead On line, the rest of the story tasks are given depending on karma. In some tasks, players are given to do a good or bad deed that will affect honor. If there are 4 players in a group, 2 of whom made one choice and 2 made another, it turns out to be a conflict, and the game itself will make the decision. If a bad deed has been committed, then the task can be completed again with a different result.
        To start playing, you need to create a character of the desired gender.
